Our Pizza Styles

The Great Plains Sauce & Dough Company offers six different pizza styles to choose from, more than anyone else we know. We've tried to come up with an interesting assortment to appeal to the adventurous spirit that lurks in all of us. If you've been eating the same old pizza for a while now, you might contemplate expanding your culinary horizons a bit, and try something a little different next time. Who knows? You may find yourself a whole new favorite style of pizza!

Our most popular pizza is something we call the Denver Style. Denver-style has a hand-rolled edge whole wheat crust, piled with our blend of real cheeses. We didn't come up with this one to be healthy. We did it because it tastes so good.

Sam's Recipe (since it was his basic offering, we named it after the man who got us started in the pizza business) is what we call our classic thin white crusted pizza. If you're a traditionalist or if you're not really hungry enough for one of our thick pizzas (this time), Sam's is just the thing to satisfy your pizza appetite.

New Orleans Style is for those who are looking for a thick pizza, but aren't wildly fond of whole wheat. (The name doesn't mean anything, by the way. We had to call it something, and New Orleans had a nice ring to it.) This one is piled with our blend of real cheeses, but we start with a thick white crust.

After all the brouhaha about how good oats are for you, we decided to work on an Oat Style pizza. And we think we came up with a good one. We don't make any claims that it'll help keep your cholesterol levels down, not with all the real cheese we pile on its hand-rolled edge oat crust, but it is a slightly sweeter, tasty alternative to the other two thick pizzas we can make for you.

For those of you who want the added flavor and texture of whole wheat, but aren't up to a thick pizza, we have Thin Denver. It's the whole wheat twin to Sam's Recipe..

And if you're looking for something just a bit out of the ordinary, you might want to try our Idaho Style pizza. It's not as crispy as our other thin styles, but has a finer, softer texture instead. The secret might be potato flour. But that's all we're going to say about it.

Because we make all our own wheat-based doughs right here, we cannot guarantee a gluten-free environment. So unfortunately, we cannot offer a gluten-free crust alternative at this time. Our white dough, for New Orleans and Sam's, and our potato dough, for Idaho Style, have dairy in them. All of our doughs have soy oil in them.
